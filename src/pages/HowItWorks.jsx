          <h3>1. Design</h3>
          <p>
            Our process begins with design and engineering. Customers can supply
            DXF files, AutoCAD drawings, or detailed specifications. Using
            state-of-the-art design software and modern engineering practices,
            we review, optimize, and prepare files to ensure accuracy,
            manufacturability, and tight tolerances before fabrication begins.

          <h3>2. Fabrication</h3>
          <p>
            Fabrication is carried out in our large, fully equipped facility
            using CNC laser cutting technology for precise and repeatable
            results. We offer a full range of fabrication capabilities,
            including TIG welding, MIG welding, metal bending, forming, and
            finishing services such as painting. This allows us to handle both
            small custom jobs and large production runs under one roof.

          <h3>3. Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            Once fabrication is complete, we ensure fast and reliable delivery
            to meet project timelines. We are capable of handling large
            quantities and shipping across North America using trusted freight
            trucking partners. Every order is carefully packaged and inspected
            to ensure it arrives safely and on schedule.
